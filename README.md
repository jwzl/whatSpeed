# whatSpeed tells you what speed
This is a tiny application written in Go that will report your download and upload speeds by running tests again speedtest.net by Ookla. The test works by downloading random images (literally np.random.random(500,500), like the image above) from the nearest* speedtest server and measuring the time it takes for the downloads to complete. Similar test for uploading.  

```
